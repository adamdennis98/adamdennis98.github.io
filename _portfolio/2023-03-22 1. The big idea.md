I've been a fan of American Football, particularly the National Football League (NFL), for over a decade now. As a supporter of the Atlanta Falcons, I've endured countless jokes about our infamous 28-3 scoreline (in case you're unfamiliar, read about it [here](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/falcons-patriots-super-bowl-28-3-lead/1xqfs41k3mfm914f6znfzj5rc9)). However, I can only handle so much before I have take matters into my own hands. That's where fantasy football comes in - a statistical points-scoring frenzy that allows me to dominate my friends and prove my football knowledge once and for all!

With our next season only 6 months away, I'm attempting to use my skills in statistical analysis and machine learning to get an edge over the competition. From initial team selection to in-season roster changes, I'm aiming to develop an understanding of how points are scored and how valuable each player is so that I can lift the Superbowl trophy one more time!
