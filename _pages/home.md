## About me:
* Member of the University of Sheffield Blast and Impact Dynamics research group, Supervised by Dr Sam Rigby.
* Current research focussed on the development of Machine Learning tools that can be used for probabilistic assessments of blast loading in complex environments.
* Graduated from the University of Sheffield in 2020 with an MEng (Hons) degree in Civil Engineering.
